You are given **TWO images**.

## IMAGE 1 (Input Image)
- The original image before editing.

## IMAGE 2 (Generated Image)
- The model-generated image after orientation editing.

Your task is to evaluate **TWO independent metrics**:

1. **Identity Consistency (IC)**  
2. **Visual Integrity (VI)**  

These two metrics MUST be evaluated **separately** and **independently**.

---

## PART 1: Identity Consistency (IC)

Identity Consistency evaluates whether the **edited subject in IMAGE 2**
remains the **same semantic object/entity** as in IMAGE 1,
ignoring changes that are directly caused by orientation editing.

### STEP 1: Identify the edited subject

- Look at **IMAGE 1** and identify the main subject intended to be edited.
- Look at **IMAGE 2** and identify the corresponding subject.

### STEP 2: Identity consistency check

Decide whether the subject in IMAGE 2 is the **same identity** as in IMAGE 1.

You MUST ignore:
- Orientation or facing-direction changes.
- Pose changes caused by reorientation.
- Perspective changes due to rotation.
- Lighting, shading, or color changes.
- Minor texture or detail variations.

You MUST penalize:
- Object replacement (e.g., shoe → different shoe type or different object).
- Object removal or duplication.
- Structural corruption (missing parts, extra parts, broken anatomy).
- Conversion into a fundamentally different semantic entity.

### IC Scoring (binary):
- **Score = 1**  
  if the subject identity and overall structure are clearly preserved.

- **Score = 0**  
  if the subject is replaced, missing, duplicated, or structurally corrupted.

If unsure, score **0**.

## PART 2: Visual Integrity (VI)

Visual Integrity evaluates whether the editing process introduced
**severe visual artifacts or layout corruption**
that significantly degrade image quality.

### STEP 3: Visual corruption inspection

Compare **IMAGE 2** against **IMAGE 1** and check for severe issues such as:

- Prominent UI or indicator pollution  
  (e.g., orientation pyramid or markers appearing in the image center).
- Large unnatural visual artifacts or rendering glitches.
- Structural image collapse  
  (e.g., extreme distortion, tearing, duplicated geometry).
- Occlusions or obstructions that severely harm image readability.

You MUST ignore:
- Orientation changes of the edited subject.
- Normal perspective changes caused by rotation.
- Lighting or color changes.
- Minor artifacts that do not significantly affect readability.

### VI Scoring (binary):
- **Score = 1**  
  if IMAGE 2 remains visually coherent and readable,
  with no severe artifacts or layout corruption.

- **Score = 0**  
  if IMAGE 2 exhibits clear visual breakdown or UI pollution.

If unsure, score **0**.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

First provide your reasoning under:
- `## Identity Consistency Analysis`
- `## Visual Integrity Analysis`

Then output the final result as **JSON (LAST PART ONLY)**:

```json
{
  "Identity_Consistency": {
    "reason": "string (one-sentence summary)",
    "score": 0
  },
  "Visual_Integrity": {
    "reason": "string (one-sentence summary)",
    "score": 0
  }
}
