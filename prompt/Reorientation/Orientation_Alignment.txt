You are given **TWO images**.

## IMAGE 1 (Input Image)
- The original image.
- A **FOUR-SIDED PYRAMID orientation indicator** is shown at the **BOTTOM-LEFT** corner.
- The pyramid defines the **TARGET orientation**:
  - The pyramid’s **tip** indicates the FORWARD direction.
  - The pyramid implicitly defines **Yaw, Pitch, and Roll**.

## IMAGE 2 (Generated Image)
- The model-generated image after orientation editing.

Your task is to evaluate whether the **FINAL orientation in IMAGE 2**
matches the **TARGET orientation defined by the pyramid in IMAGE 1**.

---

## STEP 1: Identify target object and orientation anchor

Identify the main target object whose orientation is edited.

Then determine its **Orientation Anchor** — the semantic part that defines
the object’s forward-facing direction.

Use these rules:
- Shoes → toe
- Chairs → backrest
- Cars → front / headlights
- Cameras → lens
- Humans → face
- Animals → head
- Tools / devices → functional front end

State explicitly:
- **Target object**
- **Orientation anchor**

---

## STEP 2: Describe TARGET orientation (IMAGE 1 ONLY)

Look **ONLY at IMAGE 1**.

Describe the pyramid’s orientation using **three independent axes**:

- **Yaw**: horizontal facing direction of the pyramid’s tip  
- **Pitch**: upward or downward tilt of the pyramid’s tip  
- **Roll**: leftward or rightward tilt of the pyramid body  

Rules:
- Do NOT reference the object.
- Do NOT compare with IMAGE 2.
- Do NOT use vague terms.
- Use explicit spatial descriptions.

---

## STEP 3: Describe FINAL object orientation (IMAGE 2 ONLY)

Look **ONLY at IMAGE 2**.

Using the **orientation anchor**, describe the FINAL orientation
of the object in IMAGE 2:

- **Yaw**
- **Pitch**
- **Roll**

Rules:
- Describe the actual observed orientation, not intent.
- Do NOT reference IMAGE 1 or the pyramid.
- Do NOT infer past states.
- Do NOT merge axes.
- If an axis cannot be determined, mark it as **N/A**.

---

## STEP 4: Axis-wise alignment (comparison)

Now compare the descriptions from **STEP 2** and **STEP 3**.

For EACH axis:

- **Score = 1**  
  if the FINAL object orientation matches the TARGET pyramid orientation.

- **Score = 0**  
  otherwise.

IMPORTANT:
- Scoring is based **ONLY on final alignment**.
- Do NOT use any information about whether modification was needed.

---

## STEP 5: Needs_Modification analysis (IMAGE 1 ONLY — report only)

Look **ONLY at IMAGE 1** again.

For each axis, decide whether the object’s ORIGINAL orientation
matched the pyramid’s TARGET orientation:

- **Needs_Modification = YES**
- **Needs_Modification = NO**

Rules:
- This step is **for reporting only**.
- It MUST NOT affect the score.
- Do NOT reference IMAGE 2.
- Do NOT infer from the final result.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

First provide reasoning under the following sections:

- `## Object & Anchor`
- `## Target Orientation (IMAGE 1)`
- `## Final Orientation (IMAGE 2)`
- `## Axis-wise Alignment`
- `## Needs Modification (Report Only)`

Then output the final result as **JSON (LAST PART ONLY)**:

```json
{
  "Yaw": {
    "needs_modification": true,
    "reason": "string",
    "score": 0
  },
  "Pitch": {
    "needs_modification": false,
    "reason": "string",
    "score": 0
  },
  "Roll": {
    "needs_modification": true,
    "reason": "string",
    "score": 0
  }
