You are given THREE images and ONE text prompt.

The first image:
- This is the original image.

The second image
- Visual instructions are drawn on this image based on the original image by the user.

The third image:
- This is the image generated by a model after editing the second image.

TEXT PROMPT:
- {prompt}

Your task is to evaluate whether the Output Image (The third image) correctly follows the instruction.
The instruction consists of BOTH:
(1) the visual instruction drawn on the second image, and
(2) the textual description in the Text Prompt.

You must independently evaluate the following THREE metrics and assign a binary score (1 or 0) to each:

1. Visual Instruction Localization Correctness  
Did the main edit occur on the object or region explicitly indicated by the visual instruction on the Input Image (The second image)?

2. Visual Operator Type Compliance  
Was the type of edit consistent with the operation implied by the visual instruction?

3. Textual Action Semantic Compliance  
Did the model execute the core action specified in the Text Prompt?

Scoring rules:
- Score 1 if the requirement is clearly satisfied.
- Score 0 if the requirement is not satisfied or is ambiguous.
- If unsure, assign 0.
- Partial compliance must be scored as 0.

You may reason freely to reach your decision. 
Then, for EACH metric, provide:
- "score": an integer value of 0 or 1.
- "reason": ONE short factual sentence describing an observable outcome.
This summary must strictly follow the output format specified below:

{
  "Visual_Instruction_Localization_Correctness": {
    "reason": "brief factual summary",
    "score": 1/0
  },
  "Visual_Operator_Type_Compliance": {
    "reason": "brief factual summary",
    "score": 1/0
  },
  "Textual_Action_Semantic_Compliance": {
    "reason": "brief factual summary",
    "score": 1/0
  }
}
