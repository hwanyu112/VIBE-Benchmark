You are given TWO images.

IMAGE 1 (Original Image):
- The original character image.

IMAGE 2 (Generated Image):
- The model-generated image.

Your task is to evaluate THREE independent metrics:
1) Body Instance Integrity (BII)
2) Character Identity Consistency (CIC)
3) Context Preservation (CP)

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT evaluate pose correctness.
- Do NOT compare limb positions or body posture.
- Each metric must be judged independently.

------------------------------------------------------------
Metric definitions:

(1) Body Instance Integrity (BII)
Checks whether IMAGE 2 depicts exactly ONE coherent human body instance.

Score 0 if ANY of the following occur:
- Extra or duplicated limbs (e.g., more than two arms or legs).
- Multiple bodies, torsos, or heads.
- Visible skeletons, stick figures, or pose-reference structures overlaid on the body.
- Limbs are completely missing or not visible at all
  (unless they are plausibly occluded by clothing such as long skirts).

Otherwise, score 1.

------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Character Identity Consistency (CIC)
Checks whether the character in IMAGE 2 is the SAME character as in IMAGE 1.

Focus on:
- Face and facial features (if visible).
- Hair style and hair color.
- Distinctive identity cues (e.g., glasses, accessories).

Ignore:
- Pose changes.
- Background changes.
- Minor rendering differences.

Score 1 only if identity clearly matches.
If identity is different or cannot be confidently verified, score 0.

------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Context Preservation (CP)
Checks whether elements OTHER THAN the character’s pose are preserved.

Focus on:
- Background scene.
- Clothing (style and type).
- Overall visual domain (e.g., realistic, anime).

Ignore:
- Natural cloth deformation caused by pose change.
- Minor occlusions or shading changes.

Score 0 if background, clothing, or scene elements are added, removed, or replaced.
Otherwise, score 1.

------------------------------------------------------------
Output requirements:

1) First provide your reasoning under these headers:
   - ## Analysis
   - ## Decisions

2) Then output the final JSON under:
   - ## JSON

3) Each metric must include:
   - "reason": one short factual sentence
   - "score": 0 or 1

4) The JSON must be the LAST part of your response.
