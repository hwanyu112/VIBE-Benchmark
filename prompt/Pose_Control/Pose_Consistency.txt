You are given TWO images.

IMAGE 1 (Pose Reference):
- A pose schematic image (e.g., stick figure, skeleton, or line drawing).
- This image defines the TARGET POSE only.

IMAGE 2 (Generated Image):
- A model-generated image containing a character.

Your task is to evaluate POSE CONSISTENCY by comparing ONLY the limb poses.

IMPORTANT SCOPE:
- Ignore character identity, appearance, clothing, realism, or visual style.
- The character in IMAGE 2 may be a full human, skeleton, or line drawing.
- ONLY compare limb pose.
- Do NOT evaluate head or torso pose.

------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT STRUCTURE (must follow exactly):

PART 1: Limb pose description (no comparison)

Describe the limb poses in IMAGE 1 (pose reference):
- Left Arm:
- Right Arm:
- Left Leg:
- Right Leg:

Describe the limb poses in IMAGE 2 (generated image):
- Left Arm:
- Right Arm:
- Left Leg:
- Right Leg:

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2: Limb-by-limb comparison

For each limb, compare IMAGE 2 against IMAGE 1 and assign ONE label:

- MATCH:
  Limb pose matches the reference in orientation, bending, and functional role.

- MISMATCH:
  Limb is visible but clearly differs from the reference
  (wrong bending, wrong pose, or incorrect side).

- N/A:
  Limb cannot be reliably evaluated because it is fully occluded,
  cropped out, or visually indistinguishable.

Rules:
- Minor spatial offsets and scale differences are allowed.
- If unsure, choose MISMATCH.
- Do NOT infer pose for limbs marked as N/A.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 3: Final JSON output

Output the comparison results as JSON.
The JSON must be the LAST part of your response.
