You are given THREE images and ONE text prompt.

The first image:
- This is the original image.

The second image
- Visual instructions are drawn on this image based on the original image by the user.

The third image:
- This is the image generated by a model after editing the second image.

TEXT PROMPT:
- {prompt}

Your task is to evaluate the Visual Coherence of the Output Image.

Visual Coherence evaluates whether the edited result is visually unified and generatively sound.
This metric is STYLE-AGNOSTIC: you must NOT judge realism, beauty, or artistic preference.
Instead, you must assess whether the edited image remains consistent with the source image and whether the output avoids clear generative artifacts.

You must independently evaluate the following THREE metrics and assign a binary score (1 or 0) to each:

1. Style Consistency  
Did the edited region adopt the same artistic or rendering domain as the Input Image
(e.g., line-art, watercolor, oil painting, 3D render, photographic style, pixel art, animation)?

- Score 1 if the edited region clearly belongs to the same visual domain as the source image.
- Score 0 if the edited region introduces a different artistic or rendering domain.
- Do NOT judge whether the style looks good or realistic—only whether it matches the source domain.

---

2. Visual Seamlessness  
Is the edited region visually continuous with its surrounding area, without obvious signs of compositing?

Focus on whether there are clear visual discontinuities such as:
- unnatural seams or hard boundaries,
- abrupt changes in texture, color, or resolution,
- visible cut-and-paste artifacts.

- Score 1 if the edited region integrates seamlessly with its surroundings.
- Score 0 if there are clear and noticeable discontinuities.
- Do NOT penalize stylistic roughness if it is consistent with the source image.

---

3. Artifact-Free Generation  
Does the Output Image avoid obvious, domain-independent generative artifacts?

Consider artifacts such as:
- unintended blurring or pixelation,
- geometric distortion or deformation,
- broken structures, duplicated patterns, or rendering collapse.
- residual visual instruction marks such as arrows, boxes, strokes, or masks that should not appear in the final image.

- Score 1 if no clear generative artifacts are present.
- Score 0 if obvious, non-stylistic artifacts are visible.
- Style-specific noise or abstraction is allowed if consistent with the source domain.

---

General rules:
- Evaluate ONLY visual coherence, not instruction correctness or contextual preservation.
- Minor pixel-level differences are acceptable.
- If you are unsure about a case, assign score 0.
- Partial compliance must be scored as 0.

You may reason freely to reach your decision. 
Then, for EACH metric, you provide a summary:
- "score": an integer value of 0 or 1.
- "reason": ONE short factual sentence describing an observable outcome.
This summary must strictly follow the output format specified below:

{
  "Style_Consistency": {
    "reason": "brief factual summary",
    "score": 1/0
  },
  "Visual_Seamlessness": {
    "reason": "brief factual summary",
    "score": 1/0
  },
  "Artifact-Free_Generation": {
    "reason": "brief factual summary",
    "score": 1/0
  }
