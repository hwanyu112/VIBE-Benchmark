You are given TWO images.

IMAGE 1 (Input Image):
- The original image.
- A visual arrow indicates the desired lighting direction.
- The arrow defines the TARGET light propagation direction
  (from the light source toward the subject).

IMAGE 2 (Generated Image):
- The model-generated image after lighting editing.

Your task is to evaluate Lighting Direction Consistency (LDC),
which consists of TWO sub-metrics:
1) Direction Matching Consistency (DMC)
2) Physical Lighting Consistency (PLC)

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1: Direction description (no comparison)

(1) Arrow direction in IMAGE 1:
Describe the arrow direction as a continuous spatial direction.
Use precise language (e.g., "from upper-right toward lower-left",
"slightly downward from right to left").
Do NOT reduce the direction to simple categories like left/right/up/down.

(2) Lighting direction on the subject in IMAGE 2:
Describe the dominant lighting direction ON THE SUBJECT,
inferred ONLY from surface illumination (highlights and shadows),
not from light source position or visible beams.
Use the same level of directional precision as above.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2: Direction Matching Consistency (DMC)

Compare the two described directions.

Scoring:
- Score = 1.0  
  If the directions are nearly identical with no clear angular deviation.

- Score = 0.5  
  If the lighting direction is clearly modified to follow the arrow,
  but exhibits a noticeable angular deviation (within ~90 degrees).

- Score = 0.0  
  If the lighting direction is largely different, unchanged, or ambiguous.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 3: Physical Lighting Consistency (PLC)

IMPORTANT:
- Only evaluate PLC IF DMC = 1.0.
- If DMC < 1.0, set PLC = 0 by default.

Assume the arrow direction is the TRUE light source direction.
Check whether the lighting effects on the subject in IMAGE 2
are physically consistent with that direction.

Consider:
- Which side of the subject should be illuminated.
- Which side should be in shadow.
- Whether highlights and shading agree with the arrow direction.

Scoring:
- Score = 1  
  If the observed illumination pattern on the subject
  is physically consistent with the arrow direction.

- Score = 0  
  If the illumination pattern contradicts the arrow direction.

------------------------------------------------------------
Output Requirements:

1) First provide your reasoning under:
   - ## Direction Description
   - ## Direction Comparison
   - ## Physical Consistency

2) Then output the final JSON under:
   - ## JSON

3) The JSON must be the LAST part of your response.

------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL JSON FORMAT (EXACT):

{
    "Direction_Matching_Consistency": {
      "reason": "string",
      "score": 0.0
    },
    "Physical_Lighting_Consistency": {
      "reason": "string",
      "score": 0
    }
}
