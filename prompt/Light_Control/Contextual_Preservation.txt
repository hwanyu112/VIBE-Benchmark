You are given TWO images.

IMAGE 1 (Input Image):
- The original image before editing.

IMAGE 2 (Generated Image):
- The model-generated image after lighting editing.

Your task is to evaluate Contextual Preservation (CP).

CP checks whether IMAGE 2 preserves all non-target content
from IMAGE 1 while applying the intended lighting-direction edit.

IMPORTANT SCOPE:
- This evaluation is NOT about lighting direction correctness.
- Assume lighting direction editing is the intended and allowed operation.
- CP ONLY checks whether unrelated scene content has been modified.

— Visual Instruction Rule:
- Visual instruction markings in IMAGE 1 (e.g., arrows or guides)
  are NOT part of the scene content.
- Differences related to the presence, absence, or appearance
  of these instruction markings in IMAGE 2 MUST be IGNORED,
  UNLESS they severely obstruct the subject or significantly
  degrade the visual quality of the image.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1: Allowed vs non-allowed changes

Allowed changes (do NOT penalize):
- Changes in illumination intensity, shading, or highlights.
- Changes in shadow shape or placement caused by lighting.
- Minor color shifts attributable to lighting.
- Appearance of visible light sources or light-related effects
  introduced solely to express lighting, such as:
  • bright light spots,
  • visible lamps,
  • sun glare,
  • lens flare,
  • light beams or glow effects,
  as long as they do not alter scene geometry or object structure.

Non-allowed changes (must be penalized):
- Addition or removal of non-lighting objects.
- Changes in object geometry or structure.
- Changes in scene layout or spatial arrangement.
- Replacement of materials, textures, or clothing.
- Introduction of new semantic scene elements
  unrelated to lighting (e.g., new furniture, new buildings).
- Differences involving visual instruction markings
  (e.g., arrows) that do not affect scene content.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2: Difference-based comparison

Compare IMAGE 1 and IMAGE 2 carefully.

Procedure:
1) List all observable differences between IMAGE 1 and IMAGE 2.
2) For each difference, determine whether it is:
   - a lighting-related manifestation (allowed), OR
   - an unrelated content modification (not allowed).

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 3: Contextual Preservation decision

Scoring (binary):
- Score = 1  
  ONLY if ALL observed differences fall under allowed lighting-related changes.

- Score = 0  
  If ANY difference corresponds to an unrelated content modification.

If unsure whether a difference is lighting-related or not,
treat it as NOT preserved (score 0).

Output Requirements:

1) First provide your reasoning under:
   - ## Difference Analysis
   - ## CP Decision

2) Then output the final JSON under:
   - ## JSON

3) The JSON must be the LAST part of your response.
