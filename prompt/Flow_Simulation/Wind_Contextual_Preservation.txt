You are given TWO images.

IMAGE 1 (Input Image):
- The original image before wind editing.
- This image may contain visual instruction markings
  (e.g., arrows) indicating wind direction.

IMAGE 2 (Generated Image):
- The model-generated image after wind editing.

Your task is to evaluate Wind Contextual Preservation (W-CP),
which consists of TWO sub-metrics:
1) Wind-Identity Preservation (W-IP)
2) Wind-Pose/Placement Preservation (W-PP)

IMPORTANT GLOBAL RULES:
- Visual instruction markings (e.g., arrows) are NOT scene content.
  Differences related to arrows MUST be ignored,
  unless they severely obstruct the subject or degrade visual quality.
- Wind effects are assumed to be intentional and allowed.
- Do NOT penalize changes directly caused by wind.

------------------------------------------------------------
SUB-METRIC 1: Wind-Identity Preservation (W-IP)

W-IP checks whether the wind-affected subject(s)
remain the SAME semantic entity after editing.

Focus on identity ONLY:
- Person identity (same person, same character)
- Object identity (same candle, same dandelion, same clothing item)

Explicitly IGNORE:
- Deformation, bending, or scattering caused by wind
  (e.g., flying hair, dispersed seeds, flickering flame).

Scoring:
- Score = 1  
  If the identity of all wind-affected subjects is preserved.

- Score = 0  
  If any subject is removed, replaced, duplicated,
  or transformed into a different semantic entity.

------------------------------------------------------------
SUB-METRIC 2: Wind-Pose / Placement Preservation (W-PP)

IMPORTANT:
- Evaluate W-PP ONLY IF W-IP = 1.
- If W-IP = 0, set W-PP = 0 by default.

W-PP checks whether the overall position and pose of the subject(s)
remain consistent with IMAGE 1, AFTER ignoring wind-induced effects.

Ignore the following wind-induced changes:
- Hair blowing direction or shape.
- Cloth fluttering or bending.
- Dispersal or motion of lightweight elements
  (e.g., dandelion seeds, smoke, flame shape).

Check ONLY:
- Whether the subject’s main body has shifted position.
- Whether the subject’s global orientation or stance has changed.

Scoring:
- Score = 1  
  If the subject’s overall position and pose are preserved.

- Score = 0  
  If the subject has been significantly moved, rotated,
  or reposed beyond what wind could plausibly cause.

------------------------------------------------------------
Output Requirements:

1) First provide your reasoning under:
   - ## Identity Preservation Analysis
   - ## Pose / Placement Analysis

2) Then output the final JSON under:
   - ## JSON

3) The JSON must be the LAST part of your response.

------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL JSON FORMAT (EXACT):

  "Wind-Identity_Preservation": {
      "reason": "string",
      "score": 0
  },
  "Wind-Other_Preservation": {
      "reason": "string",
      "score": 0
