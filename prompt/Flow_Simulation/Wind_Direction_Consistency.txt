You are given TWO images.

IMAGE 1 (Input Image):
- The original image.
- A visual arrow is drawn on this image indicating the desired wind direction.
- The arrow defines the TARGET wind flow direction.

IMAGE 2 (Generated Image):
- The model-generated image after wind editing.

Your task is to evaluate Wind Direction Consistency (WDC).

IMPORTANT SCOPE:
- Evaluate ONLY the wind direction.
- Do NOT evaluate physical realism, wind strength, or scene preservation.
- Ignore all non-wind-related changes.

------------------------------------------------------------
CRITICAL CAUSAL RULE (MUST FOLLOW):

Wind direction is considered valid ONLY IF it produces
visible, directionally consistent effects on at least one
wind-sensitive element in the scene.

Wind-sensitive elements include (but are not limited to):
- Hair
- Clothing or fabric
- Vegetation (e.g., trees, grass, dandelions)
- Smoke, mist, particles
- Flame shape (e.g., candles)

If wind is shown only as abstract airflow (e.g., lines or particles)
WITHOUT affecting any wind-sensitive element,
the wind direction MUST be scored as 0.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1: Direction description (no comparison)

(1) Arrow direction in IMAGE 1:
Describe the arrow direction as a continuous spatial direction.
Do NOT reduce it to simple categories (left/right/up/down).
Use precise descriptions (e.g., "from upper-left toward lower-right").

(2) Wind direction in IMAGE 2:
Infer the dominant wind direction based ONLY on visible wind effects,
such as hair, clothing, vegetation, smoke, or particles.
Describe the wind direction using the same level of precision as above.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2: Direction comparison and scoring

Compare the arrow direction and the inferred wind direction.

Scoring:
- Score = 1.0  
  ONLY if:
  (a) At least one wind-sensitive element clearly responds to wind, AND
  (b) The response direction closely matches the arrow direction.

- Score = 0.5  
  ONLY if:
  (a) Wind-sensitive elements respond to wind, AND
  (b) The response direction generally follows the arrow,
      but with a noticeable angular deviation (within ~30 degrees).

- Score = 0.0  
  In ALL other cases, including:
  - No wind-sensitive elements respond to wind.
  - Wind is shown only via abstract airflow cues.
  - Wind direction is unchanged, opposite, or ambiguous.
  - Wind-sensitive elements exist but do not move consistently
    with the arrow direction.

Output Requirements:

1) First provide your reasoning under:
   - ## Causal Wind Evidence
   - ## Direction Description
   - ## Direction Comparison

2) Then output the final JSON under:
   - ## JSON

3) The JSON must be the LAST part of your response.

------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL JSON FORMAT (EXACT):

{
  "Wind_Direction_Consistency": {
    "reason": "string (one-sentence summary)",
    "score": 0.0
  }
}
